#### 💥 UPDATES (September 12, 2025)

- Just uploaded my new dynamic resource loading system to `/hooks` and `/commands`
- It works by leveraging the submit-user-hook to *dynamically* load context and agents
- The file that handles dynamic routing is `/commands/load-dynamic-requirements.md`
- The file is loaded through the hooks in `settings.json`, specifically the submit-user-prompt hooks
- That hook points to `/hooks/load-dynamic-requirements.ts`, which loads `/commands/load-dynamic-requirements.md`

#### 💥 UPDATES (September 10, 2025)

- Initial creation of the repo and loading of the base content

## 🎯 **What is PAI?**

PAI is a project designed to give anyone in the world a personal AI infrastructure for orchestrating their personal and professional lives.

Based off my own personal Digital Assistant, **Kai**, it combines a scaffolding framework with a growing set of real-world examples.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

> **📢 Note:** Lots more examples and templates coming soon, including the full voice implementation. This repo will be continuously updated with real-world implementations from my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@unsupervised-learning).

### **Quick Start**

One thing to note is that when you download the project, the.Claude directory is hidden by default because it's a dot directory. So cd into `.claude` when you're done with the instructions.

`cd .claude`

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI.git

# 2. Check out the files (the folder is hidden with default `ls`)

ls -lah
cd ~/.claude/
ls -lah

```

### **Prerequisites**

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - The primary AI interface, which can be any similar system
- Text editor (any will work - it's all Markdown/Text!)
- Ideal: Basic command line familiarity

<br/>

## 💡 **Philosophy**

<div align="center">

### **Human 3.0: Augmentation, Not Replacement**

</div>

The PAI system embodies a fundamental belief: **AI should amplify human capability, not replace it.**

| Traditional AI | PAI Approach |
|----------------|--------------|
| Black box decisions | Transparent, file-based logic |
| Vendor lock-in | Completely portable |
| Forgets everything | Persistent memory |
| Generic responses | Personalized to you |
| Replaces thinking | Augments capability |

<br/>

## 📚 **Examples**

Coming soon! Each example will include:
- Complete file structure
- Configuration templates  
- Step-by-step setup
- Video walkthrough

### **Planned Examples**
- 📰 Daily Intelligence Briefing
- 💰 Expense Tracking & Analysis
- 📝 Content Creation Pipeline
- 🔬 Research Assistant
- 🏥 Health Monitoring
- 📚 Learning System
