## Agent Selection

### Automatic Selection

The UFC system automatically selects agents based on semantic analysis of your request:

```python
def select_agent(user_intent):
    intent_keywords = analyze_intent(user_intent)
    
    if "research" in intent_keywords:
        return "researcher"
    elif "code" or "debug" in intent_keywords:
        return "engineer"
    elif "design" or "ui" in intent_keywords:
        return "designer"
    elif "security" or "vulnerability" in intent_keywords:
        return "pentester"
    elif "architecture" or "specification" in intent_keywords:
        return "architect"
    elif "write" or "content" in intent_keywords:
        return "writer"
    else:
        return "general-purpose"
```

### Manual Selection

You can explicitly request a specific agent:

```
"Use the engineer agent to implement this feature"
"Have the researcher find information about X"
"Get the pentester to check security"
```

## Agent Configuration

### Agent Context Files

Each agent can have specific context:

```
${PAI_DIR}/context/agents/
├── researcher.md
├── engineer.md
├── designer.md
├── pentester.md
├── architect.md
└── writer.md
```

### Custom Agent Instructions

Create agent-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Engineer Agent Context

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow functional programming principles
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document all functions

## Tools Priority
1. Use existing libraries
2. Follow project conventions
3. Optimize for maintainability
```

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

### Sequential Agents

Agents can work in sequence:

```
1. Architect creates specification
2. Engineer implements solution
3. Pentester validates security
4. Writer creates documentation
```

### Parallel Agents

Launch multiple agents simultaneously:

```bash
# In your request
"Run these in parallel:
- Research latest security threats
- Engineer the authentication system
- Design the user interface"
```

## Agent Tools

Each agent has access to specific tools:

### General Tools (All Agents)
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit)
- Shell commands (Bash)
- Web searches
- Pattern matching (Grep, Glob)

### Specialized Tools

**Researcher**:
- Advanced web searches
- Academic databases
- Trend analysis tools

**Engineer**:
- Code analysis
- Testing frameworks
- Debugging tools
- Performance profilers

**Designer**:
- Browser automation
- Screenshot tools
- Visual comparison
- Accessibility checkers

**Pentester**:
- Security scanners
- Network tools
- Vulnerability databases
- Exploit frameworks

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Selection
- Let the system auto-select when unsure
- Use specific agents for specialized tasks
- Combine agents for complex projects

### 2. Task Decomposition
- Break complex tasks into agent-specific parts
- Use the architect for planning
- Assign specialized tasks to appropriate agents

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Use pentester for security validation
- Use engineer for code quality
- Use designer for UX validation

### 4. Documentation
- Always use writer for user-facing content
- Use architect for technical specifications
- Use engineer for code documentation

## Agent Performance

### Optimization Tips

1. **Clear Instructions**: Be specific about requirements
2. **Context Loading**: Provide relevant context files
3. **Tool Selection**: Let agents choose appropriate tools
4. **Parallel Execution**: Use multiple agents when possible

### Performance Metrics

| Agent | Speed | Accuracy | Complexity |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| General | Medium | High | High |
| Researcher | Slow | Very High | Medium |
| Engineer | Fast | High | High |
| Designer | Medium | High | Medium |
| Pentester | Slow | Very High | High |
| Architect | Medium | High | Very High |
| Writer | Fast | High | Low |

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Selected

```bash
# Check intent matching
grep "AGENT:" ${HOME}/Library/Logs/ufc.log

# Manually specify agent
"Please use the engineer agent to..."
```

### Agent Performance Issues

```bash
# Enable agent debugging
export AGENT_DEBUG=true

# Check agent logs
tail -f ${HOME}/Library/Logs/agent-*.log
```

### Agent Errors

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Wrong agent selected | Specify agent explicitly |
| Agent timeout | Break task into smaller parts |
| Tool access denied | Check permissions |
| Context not loaded | Verify context files exist |

## Advanced Features

### Custom Agent Creation

Create your own specialized agent:

```bash
# 1. Define agent in context
cat > ${PAI_DIR}/context/agents/custom.md << EOF
# Custom Agent
Specialized for specific domain...
EOF

# 2. Add to UFC system
# Edit user-prompt-submit-hook to include custom agent

# 3. Define agent tools
# Specify which tools the agent can access
```

### Agent Chaining

Chain agents for complex workflows:

```python
workflow = [
    ("architect", "Create system design"),
    ("engineer", "Implement core features"),
    ("designer", "Create user interface"),
    ("pentester", "Security validation"),
    ("writer", "Create documentation")
]
```

### Agent Templates

Create reusable agent configurations:

```yaml
template: web_project
agents:
  - architect: specification
  - engineer: backend
  - designer: frontend
  - pentester: security
  - writer: documentation
```

## Future Developments

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Agent Learning**: Agents that improve over time
2. **Agent Marketplace**: Share custom agents
3. **Visual Agent Builder**: GUI for agent creation
4. **Agent Analytics**: Performance tracking
5. **Agent Collaboration**: Better multi-agent coordination

### Experimental Features
