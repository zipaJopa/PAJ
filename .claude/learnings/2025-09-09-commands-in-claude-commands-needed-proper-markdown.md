## 🎭 The Full Story

### The Problem We Encountered

Commands in ~/.claude/commands/ needed proper markdown-first structure

### What We Initially Thought

We thought that we could have a single .md file with a shebang and embedded TypeScript that bun could execute directly

This led us to believe the system worked in a certain way, and we approached the problem with these assumptions.

### What We Discovered Was Actually True

What we realized was that markdown command files need separate .md documentation and .ts implementation files - bun can't execute markdown with embedded script tags

This was different from our initial understanding and required us to rethink our approach.

### The Journey: Troubleshooting Steps We Took

1. Created initial file with shebang and embedded code in script tags. 2. Tried to run it with bun and got syntax errors. 3. Realized bun expects pure TypeScript/JavaScript files. 4. Understood we need separate files for documentation and implementation

These steps helped us uncover the real issue and guided us toward the solution.

### The Solution That Worked

Created two files: capture-learning.md for documentation/narrative and capture-learning.ts for the executable TypeScript implementation

This solution addressed the actual problem rather than what we initially thought was wrong.

## 🎯 The Lesson Learned

**So now we know:** Markdown command files in ~/.claude/commands/ should have a .md file for documentation and a separate .ts file for implementation - this provides clear narrative-first documentation while maintaining executable functionality

This changes how we approach similar problems in the future because we understand the underlying mechanism better.
