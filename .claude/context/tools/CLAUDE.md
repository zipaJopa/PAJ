# 🛠️ TOOLS DOCUMENTATION - YOUR PRIMARY PROBLEM-SOLVING METHOD

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: TOOLS FIRST, ALWAYS 🚨

**STOP AND READ THIS CAREFULLY:**

When someone asks you to do ANYTHING, your FIRST thought should be:
"Which tool from my commands or services does this?"

**NOT**: "Let me write code to solve this"
**NOT**: "Let me create HTML"
**NOT**: "Let me build something from scratch"

**INSTEAD**: "Let me use the appropriate tool that already exists"

Don't use fetch to research things, use `~/.claude/commands/web-research.md` instead. 

#### 🎭 Playwright MCP Server - Browser Automation & Testing

THESE ARE YOUR EYES, Kai!
**Purpose**: This is how you help me build and fix web-based applications, webpages, etc. Use for all browser automation, visual testing, web debugging, and screenshot capture using Playwright

**🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY - ALWAYS USE THE MCP BRIDGE - NO EXCEPTIONS 🚨🚨🚨**

**THE BRIDGE IS THE ONLY WAY TO USE PLAYWRIGHT. PERIOD.**

- **EVERYONE MUST use `--browser chrome --extension`** - This is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- **This applies to:**
  - Kai (you) - ALWAYS use the bridge
  - Designer agent - ALWAYS use the bridge  
  - Engineer agent - ALWAYS use the bridge
  - Pentester agent - ALWAYS use the bridge
  - ALL agents - ALWAYS use the bridge
  - ANY Playwright usage - ALWAYS use the bridge

**🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING SESSIONS - START WITH NEW WINDOW:**
- **ALWAYS open a NEW browser window** for troubleshooting/debugging
- **DO NOT interrupt Daniel's current browser workflow**
- **The bridge will create a new window automatically**
- **This preserves Daniel's active tabs and work**
- **Start fresh for each troubleshooting session**

**WHY THE BRIDGE IS MANDATORY:**
- **Uses Daniel's real browser** - Has all cookies, sessions, and authentication
- **NO PROMPTS** - Works silently without permission dialogs
- **REAL CONTEXT** - Accesses actual logged-in state
- **NO ISOLATION** - Uses the real browser environment
- **NEW WINDOWS** - Doesn't disrupt current work

**NEVER DO THIS:**
- ❌ DO NOT use headless mode
- ❌ DO NOT use isolated mode
- ❌ DO NOT skip the --extension flag
- ❌ DO NOT use any other browser profile
- ❌ DO NOT try to use Playwright without the bridge

**CORRECT USAGE (THE ONLY WAY):**
```
mcp__playwright__ tools with --browser chrome --extension
```

**BEST PRACTICES FOR BROWSER SESSIONS:**
1. **Start troubleshooting** → Open NEW window with bridge
2. **Debug website issues** → Open NEW window with bridge  
3. **Visual testing** → Open NEW window with bridge
4. **Don't interrupt Daniel's work** → ALWAYS use new windows
5. **Each session is fresh** → Bridge creates clean new window

**If an agent doesn't use the bridge, they are doing it WRONG. There are NO exceptions to this rule.**

## 🎤 CRITICAL: AGENT VOICE SYSTEM FIX

**🚨 MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENT INVOCATIONS 🚨**

When invoking ANY agent via Task tool, you MUST include their voice configuration AND Playwright bridge instructions in the prompt:

```typescript
Task({
  description: "Brief task",
  prompt: `
    [VOICE CONFIG - MANDATORY]
    Follow your agents/${agentType}.md configuration:
    - Use [AGENT:${agentType}] tag in COMPLETED section
    - Your voice ID: ${voiceId}
    - Follow your specified output format
    
    [PLAYWRIGHT BRIDGE - MANDATORY]
    If using Playwright, you MUST use --browser chrome --extension
    The MCP Bridge is MANDATORY - no exceptions
    
    [TASK]
    ${actualTask}
  `,
  subagent_type: agentType
})
```

**Agent Voice IDs:**
- researcher: AXdz6evoL7OPd7eU12
- pentester: hmMWXCj97N5CPcRkfC
- engineer: kmSVBPu7oj4yNinwWM
- designer: ZF6FPbjXT488VcRRnw
- architect: muZKMsIGYtIkjiUS82

## 📁 AVAILABLE COMMANDS (~/.claude/commands/)

**🚨 CHECK THESE FIRST - They solve specific problems completely!**

`read ~/.claude/commands/`

Read the descriptions in each of those to understand what they're used for and when you should invoke them.

### 💰 FINANCIAL QUESTIONS - ALWAYS USE ANSWER-FINANCE-QUESTION COMMAND

**CRITICAL:** When the user asks about financial information:
1. **ALWAYS use the `answer-finance-question` command** - It parses financial PDFs and extracts specific data
2. **Include the command in your response** - Show the user what financial data was found
3. **Financial questions include**:
   - Utility bills (PG&E, water, electricity)
   - Vendor payments and amounts
   - Monthly expense patterns
   - Bill amounts from bank statements

Examples that should trigger the command:
- "What is my PG&E bill?"
- "How much do I spend on utilities?"
- "What's my typical water bill?"
- "Show me restaurant spending"
- "What utilities am I paying for?"

## 🔌 MCP SERVERS - Model Context Protocol Services

## Your full list of MCP servers is in `read Users/daniel/.claude/.mcp.json`.

Read the descriptions in each of those to understand what they're used for and when you should invoke them.

## 🚨 SPECIALIZED SCRAPING OF DIFFICULT CONTENT ONLINE (Apify MCP)

Some web content is extremely difficult to browse, scrape, or crawl with other tools, such as from LinkedIn or Facebook or Instagram or X/Twitter. For systems like that, you want to use the Apify MCP server.

**CRITICAL**: When Daniel asks about:
- **LinkedIn scraping** or getting content from LinkedIn profiles/posts
- **X (Twitter) scraping** or getting content from X profiles/posts  
- **Social media content extraction** that's traditionally difficult to crawl
- **Protected/bot-detection content** from major platforms

**YOU MUST USE THE APIFY MCP SERVER** - We have this specifically installed for handling these challenging scraping tasks that regular tools cannot access due to bot detection, authentication requirements, and anti-scraping measures.

Use `mcp__apify__search-actors` to find appropriate scrapers, then use the relevant Apify actors for the task.

## 📚 Ref MCP Server - Documentation Search For Up-to-date Development (Ref MCP)

This MCP server is for always having the most up-to-date documentation and best practices for writing code using specific technologies. So when you start a project, you should always hit this MCP server for the technologies that you are building with to make sure you are using the best practices. 

Any engineer or developer agents should always use this as well.

### Available Ref MCP Tools:

1. **ref_search_documentation** - Primary documentation search
   - Searches technical documentation for APIs, services, libraries, frameworks

## 💳 Stripe MCP Server - Payment Management

The Stripe MCP server lets us manage our production Stripe account, including creating new products, getting payment information, etc.

We primarily use it to complete the end-to-end building of new applications and hook it up to a real Stripe page where people can buy and use the product

**When to use**:
- Processing charges and refunds
- Creating and managing subscriptions
- Viewing payment history and invoices
- Managing products and pricing

**Security Considerations**:
- Always confirm amounts and customer IDs before operations
- Never expose customer payment details in responses

**Common Operations** (always verify before executing):
- Create/update customers
- Process payments
- Issue refunds (DOUBLE CHECK AMOUNTS)
- Manage subscriptions
- Generate invoices
- View transaction history

**Before ANY Stripe operation**:
1. Confirm the exact operation with the user
2. Verify customer/payment IDs
3. Double-check amounts (especially for charges/refunds)
4. Consider if test mode would be more appropriate
